//*****************************TERMINATE CHARACTER FUNCTION***********************************
// This function will replace a character glyph with a terminate glyph
// PARAMETERS:			r3 - glyph MEMORY location

// GLOBAL VARIABLES:	giTERMINATE - glyph INDEX value of the TERMINATE glylph
// RETURN VARIABLES:

terminate:
//use the red glyph for now rather than the giTERMINATE glyph
