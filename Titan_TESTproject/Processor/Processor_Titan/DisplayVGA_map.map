Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    45 out of  18,224    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  45
    Number used as Latches:                      0

    Number used as logic:                      190 out of   9,112    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             159
      Number using O5 output only:              17
      Number using O5 and O6:                   14
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    66 out of   2,278    2%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        36 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          192
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           147 out of     192   76%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     192    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          45 out of     192   23%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              35 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
