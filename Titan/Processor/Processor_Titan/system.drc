WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net pulse_OBUF is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <titan/ExStage/regfile/Mram_RAM3_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <titan/ExStage/regfile/Mram_RAM11_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <titan/ExStage/regfile/Mram_RAM2_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <titan/ExStage/regfile/Mram_RAM5_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <titan/ExStage/regfile/Mram_RAM12_RAMD_D1_O> is incomplete. The signal does
   not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
